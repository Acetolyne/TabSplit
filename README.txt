Tab Split is a Chrome extension that makes your homepage tabs open in different windows and across multiple screens.

When Chrome Browser opens it will cause each tab to move to a new window. Each window is moved to the next display.
This is useful for setting up automated monitoring in multi-headed environments.
It will trigger one time when the Chrome browser is first opened. This allows you to keep the ability to open new tabs without them being moved to a new window when you open them. 

LIMITATIONS:
The extension opens windows horizontally and will not open in a vertical manner, meaning monitors must be setup in a horizontal fashion to display correctly.

ADDITIONAL INFO:
The extension will open as many windows as you have tabs on startup. 

To change which screen the tab opens on, change the order of homepages on the Chrome settings page.

If you have more tabs set to open than you have screens then the extra tabs will open on the last monitor in a stacked fashion. 

The first window must be opened on the monitor furthers to the left. The extension opens additional windows to the right from the first opened window. To make sure it opens on the left most monitor simply make sure the last window you close is on that monitor.
